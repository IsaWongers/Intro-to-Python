The two main projects listed in this repository include a WORDLE and Blackjack game. They were made in 2024 for an Intro to Programming course, submitted as a midterm and final.
The purpose of the programs are to provide entertainment for users.

The WORDLE is a classic game where the user has a set amount of tries to guess the randomized hidden word. If they run out of guesses, that is an automatic lose. The program will
tell the user if a letter is correct and in the right position of the word by making it green and correct but in the wrong position by making it yellow. The word resets to randomize each game.

The Blackjack game follows the traditional goal of getting a total of 21 in card numbers. If the user gets more than that number, then they bust and automatically loses. The game shuffles cards
and deals them out randomly. The program includes loops, lists, and dictionaries.
